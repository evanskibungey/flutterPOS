# POS Sales Screen - Row Overflow Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: RenderFlex overflow errors in product cards
- Row widget overflowing by 6.5-17 pixels
- Error location: pos_sales_screen.dart:539 (price and button Row)

## Root Cause
The price text in product cards was not constrained, causing overflow when:
- Currency symbols are long (e.g., "KSh")
- Product prices have many digits  
- Screen sizes vary, affecting available space

## Solution Applied

### Before (Problematic Code):
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Text(
      '${_currencySymbol} ${product.price.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    ),
    Spacer(),
    SizedBox(height: 36, width: 36, child: ElevatedButton(...))
  ],
)
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(
      child: Text(
        '${_currencySymbol} ${product.price.toStringAsFixed(2)}',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
        overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
        maxLines: 1,
      ),
    ),
    const SizedBox(width: 8),
    SizedBox(height: 32, width: 32, child: ElevatedButton(...))
  ],
)
```

## Changes Made

1. **Wrapped price Text in Expanded widget**
   - Prevents overflow by constraining text to available space
   - Added `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` for graceful text truncation
   - Added `maxLines: 1` to prevent line breaks

2. **Optimized spacing and sizing**
   - Reduced font size from 18 to 16 (still readable, saves space)
   - Replaced `Spacer()` with fixed `SizedBox(width: 8)` for consistent spacing
   - Reduced button size from 36x36 to 32x32 pixels
   - Reduced icon size from 18 to 16 to fit smaller button

## Result

✅ **No more Row overflow errors**  
✅ **Consistent layout across all product cards**  
✅ **Better responsive design for different screen sizes**  
✅ **Professional text truncation with ellipsis**  
✅ **Maintains readability while optimizing space usage**

## File Modified
- `/lib/screens/pos/pos_sales_screen.dart` - Line ~539 (price/button Row)

## Testing Verified
- Product cards with long prices display correctly
- Various currency symbols handled properly  
- Consistent layout across different screen sizes
- Text truncation works as expected
- Add to cart functionality preserved

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The Row overflow issue in POS product cards has been completely fixed with responsive layout design.
